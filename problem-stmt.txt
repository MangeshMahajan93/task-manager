Tasks :
 
1. Objective: Design the database schema and interact with it using Mongoose.
 
    Database schema:
        User: _id, name, role, email, password.
        Task: _id, title, description, status (e.g., Pending, Completed), assignee (reference to a User), createdBy.
 
    Implement indexes for frequent queries (e.g., on assignee and createdBy).
 
    Seed the database with sample data.
 
2. API Development and Role Management
 
Objective: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and build RESTful APIs.
 
    Endpoints to implement:
        POST /tasks - Create a new task (accessible to Admin and Manager roles).
        GET /tasks - Retrieve a list of tasks assigned to the current user (accessible to all roles).
        PUT /tasks/:id - Update a task (only Admin or the Manager who created it can update).
        DELETE /tasks/:id - Delete a task (only Admin can delete).
 
    Requirements:
        Use middleware to enforce RBAC.
        Validate input using any library or custom validation logic.
        Implement pagination for the /tasks endpoint.
